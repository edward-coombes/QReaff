# QReaff
Allows for single url end point, to be turned into a QR code so that posters may be mass produced shared between
branches of an organization redirecting the person scanning the code to the link that is relevant to them.

Created so that a large on campus org could save money, and campaign more effectively for their reaffirmation vote.
